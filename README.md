## Types of Mental Health Apps

Mental health apps tackle diverse issues, and on this basis, they are divided into various types:

- **Mental Disorder Apps**

  Applications of this type are developed exclusively for users with serious mental diseases like eating disorders, manic-depressive psychosis, PTSD, schizophrenia, and others. As a rule, these applications use only well-researched treatment strategies.

  Using mental disorder apps, people can feel more confident due to 24/7 online doctor availability. Comprehensive medical monitoring along with regular online consultations make treatment much easier.

- **Mental Self-Improvement Apps**

  Self-improvement apps are leveraged to check and monitor general mental state, resolve slight disorders, lead a healthy lifestyle, get motivated, etc. These apps also fall into a few subgroups:
---
  - **General mental health applications**

        General mental health applications help to establish self-care through mood control and the implementation of healthy habits. The apps may include diverse features, such as questionnaires, community support, 24/7 chat with licensed psychologists. Numerous self-care tips are aimed at coping with different negative feelings.

  - **Addiction recovery applications**

        Breaking bad habits on one’s own efforts can be a task beyond one’s strength, so very often people need additional help. Addiction recovery apps offer trackers, reminders, a supportive community, and a ton of useful information.

  - **Anxiety applications**

        Anxiety, frustration, and stress are common things in modern society, therefore there are a number of apps tackling these issues. They offer multiple relaxation exercises and efficient motivation plans, providing positive results by making app users feel confident and calm again.

- **Multipurpose Mental Health Apps**

  While some applications are designed to help overcome a particular mental disorder, others offer diverse functionality and services tackling a number of mental health issues at once, so anyone can find what they need.

## Key Features of Mental Health Apps

From the beginning, it is important to determine the features that a mental health application will provide to end-users. Of course, a final set of features may vary from app to app. Still, we would like to draw your attention to those that are considered to be paramount and that the best mental health apps usually offer:

- **Video consultations**

  The ability to get consultations from a licensed specialist is of primary importance especially when it comes to serious mental disorders. Therefore, the implementation of video conferences in an app is definitely a good idea that will be appreciated by doctors and patients.
